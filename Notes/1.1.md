# 1.1 - The Elements of Programming

- **A programming language**
  - More than just a way to provide instrutions
    - A framework for organizing our ideas
    - Take note of the means the language provides to combining ideas

  - The mechanisms of thought:
    - Primitive expressions
      - The simplest entities the language is concerned with
    - Means of combination
      - How can we combine simple entities?
    - Means of abstraction
      - How can we manipulate compound elements as units?

- **Expressions**
  - Simple interactions with Scheme
    - Prefix notation
      - Accomodates arbitrary # of args
      - Allows for easy nesting
      - Examples:
        - `1` -> 1
        - `(+ 1 1)` -> 2
        - `(/ 10 5)` -> 2
        - `(+ (* 2 10) (- 4 3))` -> 21

- **Naming & Environment**
  - What means does our programming language provide us for referring to objects with names?

  - Naming with Scheme
    - Use the keyword `define`
      - `define size 2`
      - The interpreter will associate the value 2 with the name `size`
      - Our simplest means of abstraction

  - Environment
    - How are we supposed to retrieve values with symbols?
      - By using the environment (rather the global environment)
      - A computation may have many environments

- **Evaluating Combinations**
  - Goal: isolate issues about thinking procedurally

  - How is the interpreter evaluating combinations?
    1. Evaluate the sub expressions of the entire combination (recursively)
    2. Apply the operator to the values of the operands

  - Recursion as a powerful technique for dealing with tree-like structures

  - The nature of this procedure is an example of *tree accumulation*, in which values percolate up the tree
    - In this case, the values stem from the sub expressions

  - The environment plays a role in evaluating procedures

  - Special forms
    - Exceptions to the general evaluation rule
    - Example: `define`

- **Compound Procedures**
  - Simple elements in Lisp (present in all programming languages)
    - Numbers (primitive data) and arithmetic operations (primitive procedures)
    - Nesting of combinations (a means of combining operations)
    - Definitions, map a value to a name (a means of abstraction)

  - Procedure definitions (functions)
    - A powerful abstraction technique
      - A compound operation with a name, referred to as a unit
    - Example:
      - A square procedure definition:
        - `(define (square x) (* x x))`
    - General form of a procedure definition:
      - `(define (<name> <params>) (<body>))`

  - Can use a procedure as a building block for other procedures, etc
    - Example
      - `(define (sum-of-squares x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))`

- **The Substituion Model**
  - Essentially, the interpreter evaluates the body of the procedures by replacing each formal parameter with the argument

  - Use this model as a way to consider procedure application

  - A building block for more refined models
    - How can we handle mutable data?

  - Applicative vs Normal order
    - A different way to evaluate expressions
      - Only evaluate expressions when their value is needed
      - Substitute in values until all that's left is primitive expressions to evaluate
      - Named `normal-order-evaluation`

    - Lisp uses `applicative-order evaluation`
      - Additional efficiency due to avoided duplicate computations

    - Something cool: on procedures that can be modeled using substitution (that produce legit results), both evaluation methods will yield the same result.

- **Conditional Expressions and Predicates**
  - Need a way to perform operations depending on a result
    - `case analysis`
    - if (else if) else !
    - Use `cond` notation in Lisp

  - `predicate` is used to procedures that return a boolean or expressions that evalute to a boolean
