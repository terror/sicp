# 1.1

- We direct computational processes with programs
  - Much like how a sorcerer casts spells
  - We use programming languages to tell the process what tasks to perform

- A process is much like a socerer's idea of a spirit
  - It will execute programs

- Speak of "master" software engineers
  - The ability to reason that programs will perform correctly *in advance*
  - Being able to *debug efficiently*
  - Craft modular structures, in order to help with the latter point

- LISP
  - [Paper](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)
  - Despite the formalisms, it's a practical language
  - The interpreter carries out processes which are described using Lisp
  - Atoms and Lists
  - Evolved informally
    - Responded to users needs
    - Many dialects
      - Using Scheme dialect of Lisp

  - Why are we using it?
    - A good medium for education on programming constructs and data structures
    - Lisp description of processes: *procedures*
      - These procedures can be manipulated as Lisp data (metaprogramming!)
    - It's great fun!
