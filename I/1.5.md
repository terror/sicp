# 1.5

What behaviour can we expect when the procedure below is interpreted with an interpreter
that uses applicative-order evaluation?

```lisp
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
(if (= x 0)
0
y))

(test 0 (p))
```

Recall:
- applicative-order evaluation: "evaluate arguments then apply"
- normal-order evaluation: "fully expand then reduce"

Thus, using applicative order, (p) gets expanded to itself forever. By
evaluating the subexpressions of the combination we apply (test 0 (p)) infinitely.

By using normal-order evaluation we reduce test to (if (= 0 0) 0 p) which reduces to (if (true) 0 p) which returns 0. This is because
normal order evaluation will expand each subexpression first *and then* reduce.
