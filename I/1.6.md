# 1.6

Why does if need to be a special form? Can't we just use cond to define it as an ordinary procedure?

Introducing a new-if procedure:

```lisp
; new-if
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5) ; 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5) ; 0

; used for square-root program
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

The fact that `if` is a special form means something important. When the interpreter follows applicative-order evaluation, it will only evaluate one of it's parameters.

The redefinition in terms of generic arguments removes this special property, evaluating each parameter, therefore causing the square root program to call itself infinitely.
